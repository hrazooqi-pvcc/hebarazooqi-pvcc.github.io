  <h1> Introduction</h1>
Congress has specific and separated areas of power that constitute the US government. Congress is equally known as the 
 legislative branch of the 3 main branches of government. The power serves to authorize decisions at times along with the executive branch.  Additionally, Congress makes many decisions and represents citizens of the nation. The citizens vote for who they want to be represented in the council through elections. The main administration of the US is centered around a democracy where citizens 
 and members of Congress vote. Allowing decisions and rulings to be made.

  <h1> Powers</h1>
  <ul>
    <li> Declare war.</li>
    </ul>
<ul>
    <li> Annual budget</li>
  This power controls taxes and funding to government assistance. Additionally, this power exercises how money is spent
  and how the budget looks like for the US government.
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Make Laws</li>
    Congress can create laws and policies to be sent to the executive branch. It is noted that even though the 
    President may veto the law, Congress can still override the decision through a third party.    

  </ul>
<ul>
    <li> Committe hearings</li>
 To deal with issues surrounding health care, public safety, and crimes, the hearings allowed investigations. 
Allowing members of Congress to deal with the concerns the citizens are facing. Criminal justice and investigations are also ruled
by the members of Congress. This means warranties and decisions involving crime are also tied to the roles of Congress. 
One type of hearing that Congress uses to analyze effectiveness is called the Oversight hearing. The members use this 
information to adjust or observe the existing policy. Allowing them to get feedback and fix issues surrounding the 
community. In short, hearings led by Congress allow the community to share their concerns and opinions on the completed policies.
Congress uses that information and creates solutions to serve the needs of their community and provide resources. Another 
basis for composing the committee hearings is to incorporate aid to the executive and judicial branches. This serves resolutions 
for criminal cases or associations.
<h1> History of Congress</h1>
The power granted to the US Congress follows specific articles from the Constitution. The formation of the branch began around 
1789. Before this time, the rulers of the US colony were criticized for the power. They were emitted by the members alongside the King
since they felt that they too deserved as much influence. As time went on, the representatives declared that their power was just as significant 
which perished the founders of Congress. The legislative branch became one of the most powerful and influential branches at the time.
So, to keep the power equal, checks and balances were designed to systemize the branches.
By doing this, power within the branches are maintained and surveillanced.

<h1> Bicameral</h1>
The composition of Congress is made up of the House of Representatives and Senators. Meaning, that it is a bicameral system that subjects
each member to a position and role. Another purpose of structuring the branch was to limit the power of Congress. By doing this, 
the members are equally dispersed and avoid discriminatory practices.  
<h1> Conclusion</h1>
The powers of Congress contribute to the US government through funding, war, laws, and hearings. This branch is heavily involved
in the country's policies and criminal collusion. However, due to its high responsibility, checks and balances are placed to
limit the power and control the amount of influence. One thing to note is that even though the executive branch may veto laws,
Article 4. Section 5 states that two or third parties can be permitted and are necessary. The historical background of Congress was
initially made to stop the tyrant ruling of the King and present that Congress should have just as much power during a decision.
Finally, bicameralism is a system used in Congress to disperse and concentrate the members. The two sectors include the House of Representatives
and Senators. These positions also limit Congress by creating boundaries and categories in place for issues among citizens.
