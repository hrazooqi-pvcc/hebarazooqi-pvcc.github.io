                When programmers are learning a new programming language, 
                they often learn to code a simple program called "Hello World."
                That is what I am doing with this HTML code!
            </p>
            <ul> 
                <ol> Radius: 3,959 miles </ol>
                <ol> Fifth largest planet in the solar system </ol> 
                <ol> Water covers 70% of the surface </ol>
                <ol> Not a perfect sphere; it is wider around its middle </ol>
                <ol> Spinning at just over 1,000 miles per hour </ol>
                <ol> Moving around the sun at 67,000 miles per hour </ol>
                <ol> Deepest point in the ocean floor is the Mariana Trench </ol>
            </ul>
